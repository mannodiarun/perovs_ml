This notebook reads a DFT dataset of ABX3 perovskites and trains ML models for predicting their band gaps (PBE and HSE), refractive index, and photovoltaic figure of merit.

In this notebook, we: 
(a) read the data, including DFT computed properties and descriptors
(b) initize neural network frameworks for regression using keras
(c) train and test best regression models, visualize the predictions
